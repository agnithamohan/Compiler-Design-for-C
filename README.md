# Compiler Design for C
This project aims to design a primitive compiler for C language. 
The compiler will be designed to handle:
* the following basic data types:int, float
* a basic if-else construct 
* a for looping construct 
* a nested-for looping construct 
* the five basic operator: +,-,=,*,/ 
* user defined functions with void return type and a single parameter
