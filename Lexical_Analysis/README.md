# Project Title

Lexical Analysis is the first phase of Compiler Design. A lexical analyzer is commonly referred to as a scanner. In this phase the source program is converted into a sequence of tokens. A tool called Lex is used to implement this phase. 

## Getting Started-Steps to compile and run
1. lex scanner.l
2. gcc lex.yy.c
3. ./a.out <test.c

## Prerequisites

To run this on your computer, you will need Lex. 

## Installing

Steps to install Lex in Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install byacc flex

## Running the tests

Run tests by adding the test file's name in the last step of compiling and running. 
eg: To run test-1.c 
./a.out <test-1.c
